# ASP.NET Core Localization Sample
The example contains localization in these topics:
- DisplayAttribute
- Validation Attributes 
- Model Binding errors 
- Using a Shared resource for Views and Controllers
- Alows user to change culture at run-time
- Applies direction (rtl/ltr) based on the selected culture

The example is ready to run, you can get it and run it to see the result. Based on seleted culture from language menu, you can see localized content and validation messages for application. I've created this example as an additional resource for the answer of this question in stackoverflow: [ASP.NET Core Model Binding Error Messages Localization](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40828570/asp-net-core-model-binding-error-messages-localization).

It has been tested using *Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 1.1.0* using both *.NET Core* and *.NET 4.6.1*.
